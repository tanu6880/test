Today is the anniversary of the publication of Robert Frost’s iconic poem “Stopping 
by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” a fact that spurred the Literary Hub office into a long conversation about their 
favorite poems, the most iconic poems written in English, and which poems we should all have already 
read (or at least be reading next). Turns out, despite frequent (false) claims that poetry is dead and/or irrelevant and/or boring, there are plenty 
of poems that have sunk deep into our collective consciousness as cultural icons. (What makes a poem iconic? For our purposes here, 
it’s primarily a matter of cultural ubiquity, though unimpeachable excellence helps any case.) So for those of you who were not present 
for our epic office argument, I have listed some of them here.

NB that I limited myself to one poem per poet—which means that the impetus for this 
list actually gets bumped for the widely quoted (and misunderstood) “The Road Not Taken,” but so it goes. 
I also excluded book-length poems, because they’re really a different form. Finally, despite the headline, I’m sure there are many, 
many iconic poems out there that I’ve missed—so feel free to extend this list in the comments. But for now, happy reading
